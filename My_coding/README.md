# [My_coding](https://github.com/trived76/Work_after_the_masters/tree/master/My_coding): 

This branch of the root repository contains a Jupyter notebook for the code that I write for my practice. Description of different files are mentioned below. If you have any suggestion for optimizing the code then feel free to send a pull request.

## Description about files:

1) [Coding_practice.ipynb](https://github.com/trived76/Work_after_the_masters/blob/master/My_coding/Coding_practice.ipynb): 
This file contains all the solutions and it is updated frequently.

2) [Problem_statements](https://github.com/trived76/Work_after_the_masters/tree/master/My_coding/Problem_statements):
This sub-directory contains all the problem statements.

### Problem Description: 

1) [Querying array elements and counting](https://github.com/trived76/Work_after_the_masters/blob/master/My_coding/Problem_statements/Problem1_Sparse_Array.png):
Problem says that two different arrays (or lists) are given as an input. Names of the two inputs are, String and Query. String is a list of different elements and Query is a list of the elements that are to be searched in the String list. Thus, the final outcome should be a list with the occurance of each element of the Query after searching each element in String. For example, String = ['abc','sdjfh','c'] and Query = ['r','c','dfg'] are taken as input. The final output should be Count_query = [0,1,0]. It is because the occurance of each elements of the Query- 'r' is 0, 'c' is 1 and 'dfg' is 0 in the String.
